# Sine Wave Interference Warbling
This website demonstrates how audio waves of different frequencies blend together and cancel each other out, and how the closer two frequencies are, the slower the warbling will be.

Try it out!

## Try All Of These Combinations
129 hz and 130 hz.

Now 129 hz and 131 hz.

Now 129 hz and 129.1 hz. (Wait it out, notice the changes)

Singers can use sine waves to train pitch accuracy, as they sing one note against a sine wave and aim to minimize the warbling.

## Additional
This project was made in about 4.75 hours, an experiment completely carried by ChatGPT, with only experience in simple WebDev.

I did learn some things along the way as I tried to fix things, but ChatGPT did the heavy lifting as I told it what new features I want.

It makes me curious what the future of programming holds.
