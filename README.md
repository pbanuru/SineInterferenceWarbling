# Sine Wave Interference Warbling
This website demonstrates how audio waves of different frequencies blend together and cancel each other out, and how the closer two frequencies are, the slower the warbling will be.

Try it out!

## Try All Of These Combinations
129 hz and 130 hz.

Now 129 hz and 131 hz.

Now 129 hz and 129.1 hz. (Wait it out, notice the changes)

Singers can use sine waves to train pitch accuracy, as they sing one note against a sine wave and aim to minimize the warbling.

## Additional
This project was made in about 4.75 hours, I had ChatGPT do most of the work. I was very curious what it was capable of (GPT3 I believe), and it impressed me!
